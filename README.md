# Writing a Markdown compiler

This is my attempt at building a tokenizer / Markdown compiler, as I work through [this article](https://blog.beezwax.net/2017/07/07/writing-a-markdown-compiler/). The original is in Ruby; I'm trying to translate it to JavaScript and take a more functional approach.

## Installing

If you'd like to run the tests, you'll need to `npm install` (unless you already have `jest` installed globally).

Then you can run the tests by `npm run test tokenizer.test.js`
